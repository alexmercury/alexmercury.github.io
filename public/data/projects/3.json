    "Tipnpost is cloud-based interactive software that connects Bar, Restaurant, and Nightclub staff, of all sizes, for the purpose of sharing, organizing, and managing tips. Our easy to use interface features advanced Reports and simple Tip Forms with automatic calculations, reducing errors, saving you valuable time.",
    "Web app helps extremely easy to organize tips so that staff know exactly what they made. Admin web dashboard use Angular 1.5.8 and Rails 4.2.6. I developed the Tipnpost integration module with the restaurant's POS terminal, but there were some difficulties because not all the data we need can be provided by the POS terminal."
