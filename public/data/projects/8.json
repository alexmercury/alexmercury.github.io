    "Modularity the Collaborative Finance Platform. Headcount Planning, Budget Variance Reporting, Procurement & Purchasing. When you’ve built your model and you need to manage spend, budgets, and headcount in one easy-to-use platform, try Modularity.",
    "Pulling data from existing FP&A systems and back-and-forth emailing with each department separately. Building static dashboards that aren’t actionable and don’t give managers the ability to transparently spend, request, and prioritize budgets in a way that they see most effective. Context for decision making, strategy, and prioritization getting lost in one-off emails. Best-guess spend and headcount forecasting for months ahead that became obsolete when business priorities changed."
