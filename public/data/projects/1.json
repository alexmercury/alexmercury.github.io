    "Max is an assistant that helps your WhatsApp group coordinate the next get together. With Max, there is no more confusion and you will actually meet.",
    "Start-up project. It is a bot written in Ruby on Rails. It utilizes WhatsAPI (written in PHP) that allows sending messages to WhatsApp client. The bot is added to whatsapp groups, accepts certain typed commands and sends responses. The main goal of the app is to provide users with an ability to organize events through whatsapp, find out who's participating, where and when, and manage their meetings. I developed the whole server-side mechanism of the app, but got some help with the frontend stuff."
