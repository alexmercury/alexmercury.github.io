## Description

* ‚û°Ô∏è Pulling data from existing FP&A systems and back-and-forth emailing with
  each department separately.
* ‚û°Ô∏è Building static dashboards that aren‚Äôt actionable and don‚Äôt give managers
  the ability to transparently spend, request, and prioritize budgets in a way
  that they see most effective.
* ‚û°Ô∏è Context for decision making, strategy, and prioritization getting lost in
  one-off emails.
* ‚û°Ô∏è Best-guess spend and headcount forecasting for months ahead that became obsolete
  when business priorities changed
