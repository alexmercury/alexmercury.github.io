## Description

Private system that manages the execution of works on channel wiring of
an Internet cable in **Australia**.
Users are assigned tasks/jobs, they write their progress on each task at the
end of each working day and this way the progress is tracked. The system manages
the calculation of payment for work and transfers the data directly to
the payment system. There is also a reporting functionality.
