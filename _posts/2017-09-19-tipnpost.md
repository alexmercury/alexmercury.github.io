**Tipnpost** is cloud-based interactive software that connects _Bar_,
_Restaurant_, and _Nightclub_ staff, of all sizes, for the purpose of sharing,
organizing, and managing tips.
Our easy to use interface features advanced Reports and simple Tip Forms with
automatic calculations, reducing errors, saving you valuable time.

## Description

Web app helps extremely easy to organize tips so that staff know exactly what
they made.
Admin web dashboard use _Angular 1.5.8_ and _Rails 4.2.6_.
I developed the **Tipnpost** integration module with the restaurant's
_POS terminal_, but there were some difficulties because not all the data
we need can be provided by the _POS terminal_.

## My Tasks

* \- Added [Omnivore](https://omnivore.io) to the _"Add-ons"_ section and
created a paid addon that will ask the user to install and use it with separate
[Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) subscriptions.
* \- developed a ruby wrapper for the [Omnivore API](https://omnivore.io/api/)
* \- functionality for adding a client POS-terminal in **Tipnpost**.
  > (by installing the .exe on POS terminal and adding to Tipnpost via Omnivore)
* \- get all the data we need for **Tipnpost**
  > (POS users, product categories, etc.)
* \- separate the POS terminal data on drinks/food, charge/cash tips from
**Omnivore** and enter them in the application tip form.
* \- manual testing and writing RSpec tests
