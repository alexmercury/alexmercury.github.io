#### ðŸ”¥ Project in production

**Chime** is a financial technology company founded on the premise that basic
banking services should be helpful, easy and free. We want to profit with our
members, not from them. Thatâ€™s why our model doesnâ€™t rely on overdraft fees,
monthly service fees, service fees, minimum balance requirements, and more.
