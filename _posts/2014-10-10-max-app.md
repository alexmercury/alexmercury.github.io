## Description

Start-up project. It is a _bot_ written in
[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).  
It utilizes _WhatsAPI_ (written in PHP) that allows sending messages to
[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) client.
The _bot_ is added to _whatsapp groups_, accepts certain typed commands and
sends responses. The main goal of the app is to provide users with an ability
to organize events through _whatsapp_, find out who's participating, where and
when, and manage their meetings.
I developed the whole server-side mechanism of the app, but got some help
with the frontend stuff.

## My Tasks

* \- developed a ruby wrapper for the _WhatsAPI_ PHP library
_(no WhatsApp API for bots was available in 2014)_
* \- writing regular expressions for text analysis and command processing
* \- manual testing and writing RSpec tests
* \- deployment of the project on Heroku in production and staging modes

## Used technologies, API, tools

* \- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* \- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
